I feared/suspected this site was purely archival, but my brain can't not make playlists so even though it's real slow (a lot of these have been gradually cooking up over several years) I am now putting out some content.

No fancy mixing, just Spotify playlists due to time constraints and software constraints, but they're certainly inordinantly *fussed* over still.

It still doesn't quite feel the same as the full-blown episode/mixes, so given that radio is dead and streaming is redundant in these times we're going from <s>Radio</s> Slip<s>stream</s> to The Slip.
